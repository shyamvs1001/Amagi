Please run TransformWord.java with the below arguments

args[0] = file path eg:c:/users/shyamvs/desktop/linuxwords.txt
args[1] = starting word
args[2] = ending word

Assumption: words are all lower case.

The program can be easily modified to read from console instead of args.

The output is printed on the console.

The graph is formed once and can be reused for multiple input pairs of words for transformation.
